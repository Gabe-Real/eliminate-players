# Modrinth

If you're seeing this, this means that you have mismatched config and is using the Modrinth launcher.and

## How to fix

1. Open your file explorer
2. In the top bar type `%appdata%` and hit enter
3. Scroll until you find the ModrinthApp folder and open it.
4. Go to the profiles folder and find your profile.
5. Once you're in your profile go to config → `eliminateplayers.json` and change the banned uuid to the matching one.

## Adding more

If you wish to add more uuids to the json, simply add a comma after the first uuid then continue as usual.

For example:

```JSON
{
  "bannedUuids": [
    "d0815131-c51a-4831-b973-f69da01e6326"
  ]
}
```

```JSON
{
  "bannedUuids": [
    "d0815131-c51a-4831-b973-f69da01e6326", ← add comma
    "add-your-uuid-here" ← add your uuid here
  ]
}
```
