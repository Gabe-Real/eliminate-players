## FAQ

**Q: Can I become the ghost and freak out my friends with my amazing, ominous powers?**

**Q: Can you backport this mod to 1.x? When will you update to [Older version]?**

If you want it updated to newer versions, feel free to contribute to the mod and make a pull request, it's appreciated! Otherwise, don't come begging.
